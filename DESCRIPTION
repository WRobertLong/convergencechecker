Description: This package provides functions to assess the convergence status of 
             models fitted using popular R packages, such as lme4, nlme, and 
             glmmTMB. It checks for issues related to non-convergence, singular 
             fits, and near-zero random effect variances, helping users diagnose 
             model fitting problems. Designed for mixed-effect models and models 
             with random effects, the package automates convergence checking, 
             providing informative warnings and guidance.
